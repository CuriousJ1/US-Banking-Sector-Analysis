## Introduction

In this project, we focus on the exploratory data analysis of the US banking sector through the years of 2006 to 2016. This time series includes the global financial crisis which occured in 2009.

The US banking sector sector companies we include are 

* Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

The code is based on my own exploration of Python's functionalities, libraries and Quandl's API.
