# US-Banking-Sector-Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, we focus on exploratory data analysis of the US banking sector through the years of 2006 to 2016 which includes the global financial crisis.

The code is based on my own exploration of Python's functionalities, libraries and Quandl's API.
